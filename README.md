## Overview of the Analysis

In this analysis, Deep neural networks were created and taughting using company fund request information to determine whether the companies become successful. 3 different models were created with varying nodes and layers.

## Results

* Model 1:
  * Accuracy: 0.73
  * Loss: 0.556

* Alternative Model 1:
  * Accuracy: 0.729
  * Loss: 0.667

* Alternative Model w:
  * Accuracy: 0.731
  * Loss: 0.566

## Summary

Although the neurons of each model was adjusted, a large increase in accuracy was unable to be found. This would require more research into how neural networks can be imporoved and what factors would dictate a higher accuracy.
